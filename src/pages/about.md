Archipelago is a multidisciplinary project, bridging journalism, speculative fiction, visual arts, community organizing, and politics. 

**Mission**

The goal of this site is to nurture Hawaii's collective imagination for the future of our archipelago, which Mark Twain described as "_The Loveliest Fleet of Islands that lies Anchored in any Ocean_." We're capable of incredible things, but first we have to a sense of where we're going. The goal of Archipelago is to provide visual substance for our future island home.
